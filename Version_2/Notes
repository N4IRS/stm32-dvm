I will upload pre-built binaries ready for upload at http://dvswitch.org/files/HAM/MMDVM/

Building firmware from source
=============================
Login as root or use sudo -s
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -Y

cd /srv
git clone https://github.com/N4IRS/stm32-dvm.git
cd /srv/stm32-dvm
chmod +x *.sh
./required-libs.sh
./get-src.sh

You now have the needed utilities and source code for the firmware.

cd /usr/src/MMDVM
Do a test to make sure everything builds correctly
make -f Makefile.CMSIS
No errors?

The firmware is in the /usr/src/MMDVM/bin directory


Upload firmware to STM32-DVM USB
================================
Disconnect STM32-DVM from the host USB
Insert JP1 jumper
Connect STM32-DVM to the host
PWR, ACT and DMR MUST be lit solid, NOT flashing.

stm32flash -w bin/mmdvm.hex -v /dev/ttyUSB0

Disconnect STM32-DVM from host USB
remove JP1 jumper
Connect STM32-DVM to host USB
start MMDVMHost

=================================================

Upload firmware to the STM32-DVM PiHat  
Shutdown the Raspberry Pi
Disconnect power to Raspberry Pi
Insert JP1 jumper
Power ON the Raspberry Pi
PWR, ACT and DMR MUST be lit solid, NOT flashing.

stm32flash -w bin/mmdvm.hex -v /dev/ttyAMA0

Shutdown the Raspberry Pi
Disconnect power to Raspberry Pi
remove JP1 jumper
Power ON the Raspberry Pi
start MMDVMHost
